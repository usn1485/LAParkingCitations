# LAParkingCitations
A Data Analyst project about L.A Parking Citations

Our project is to analyze LA Parking Citations uncovering patterns in areas, cars makes, time of day, day of the week and issuing agency. Visualization will include a Heat Map for high ticketing areas and bar charts for types of cars. Time of day and areas will be analyzed for patterns and correlations. Violation descriptions will be compared to agency and areas. Color type will be analyzed for any outstanding trends. 
  -Are there worse times of day when tickets are written?
  -Certain streets worse than others?
  -Do certain cars get more tickets than others?
  -Do certain areas get different fines than others? Do violations get the exact same amount of fine?
  -Does having soon to be expired plates make you more at risk for a ticket?
  -Do foreign made cars receive more or less tickets?
