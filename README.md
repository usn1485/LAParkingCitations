# LAParkingCitations
A Data Analyst project about L.A Parking Citations

Our project is to analyze LA Parking Citations uncovering patterns in areas, cars makes, time of day, day of the week and issuing agency. Visualization will include a Heat Map for high ticketing areas and bar charts for types of cars. Time of day and areas will be analyzed for patterns and correlations. Violation descriptions will be compared to agency and areas. Color type will be analyzed for any outstanding trends.
